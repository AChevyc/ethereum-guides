This is supposed to be a step-by-step guide for dummies on Ethereum mining via Betarigs. A detailed knowledge of the concept expressed throughout will surely help, but it is not necessary to follow the guide. If you are interested in deepening your knowledge, please follow the link below:

At the final step of renting hashrate on Betarigs, you are usually asked to provide a mining pool address. 

We are waiting for what etherchain.org does with their mining pool and see...
