##Ethereum GPU Mining... using EC2 spot instances! (save 40% on avg)##

Ethereum mining on aws costs more than running your own minining rig. Fact.
But... what if we use spot instances?

To deal with non-persistency of spot instances, run a regular instance, 
1. install all you need to get ethereum mining up and running
2. Stop the instance
3. Create an image or private AMI http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html 


On your android device (leave this here for now):
* Copy your **_.pem_** File into your sd card. If there is no sd card in your android, transfer it via usb
* Download and launch Juice SSH app
